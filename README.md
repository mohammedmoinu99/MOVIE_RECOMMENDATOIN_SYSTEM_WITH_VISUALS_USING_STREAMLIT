# MOVIE_RECOMMENDATOIN_SYSTEM_WITH_VISUALS_USING_STREAMLIT
# INTRO
Now a day’s recommendation system has changed  the  style of searching the things of our interest.
The most popular areas where recommender  system is  applied are books, news, articles, music, videos, fashion, products & movies etc.
In this project  I have proposed a movie recommendation system.
The user can then browse the recommendations easily and find a movie of their choice. 

In today’s world where internet has become an Part of human life, users often face the problem of too much choice.

From looking for a good Content options, there is too much information available.

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in today’s extremely busy world.

The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual

Recommendation system is information filtering approach that is used to predict the preference of that user.  

Recommender Systems have added to the economy of the some of the e-commerce websites (like Amazon.com) and Netflix which have made these systems a salient parts of their websites. 
A glimpse of the profit of some websites is shown in below:
	Netflix 2/3rd of the movies watched are recommended 
	Google News recommendations generate 38% more click-troughs
	 Amazon 35% sales from recommendations 
	Choicestream 28% of the people would buy more music if they found what they liked
Recommender Systems generate recommendations; the user may accept them according to their choice and may also provide, immediately or at a next stage, an implicit or explicit feedback.
# TYPESOF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM :

1.	Content Recommendation System
2.	Collaborative Recommendation System
3.	Hybrid Recommendation System
4.	
# Methodology: 
The methodology to complete this project is as follows: 
	I explored data of Movies, concepts of Machine learning and Python
	After that I try to deploy the model using streamlit., I even referred to some articles books journals, websites and news articles 
Below are the important concepts on which the work has been done and with the support of these  I was able to work on my project. 
# CountVectorizer:

CountVectorizer is a great tool provided by the scikit-learn library in Python. It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.

# Cosine-Similarity : 
 
Cosine Similarity between the two non-zero vectors. A vector is a single-dimensional signal NumPy array. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity, often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.

# Pickle Module: 

It is a process where a python object are created into byte stream.
The Python pickle module is another way to serialize and deserialize objects in Python. It differs from the json module in that it serializes objects in a binary format, which means the result is not human readable. However, it’s also faster and it works with many more Python types right out of the box, including your custom-defined objects. 

# Proposed System: 

The Application will have capability to maintain gives an idea about the movies amount need to watch by the person. 
This Application consists of certain details like
1. Genre		 2. Actor 	3.Director 
4. Year 		5. Rating
Based on the details it will predict movie recommendation  
The web app is simple.

# Software Specifications 
	OS: Windows
	Python IDE: python 2.7.x and above
	Jupyter Notebook
	Setup tools and pip to be installed for 3.6 and above
	Language: Python
# Hardware Requirements 
	RAM:  4GB and higher
	Processor: Intel I3 and above
	Hard Disk: 500 GB minimum
# APPLICATIONS 
	Increased user satisfaction
	Useful for Increased in sales/conversion for companies
	To have a system that is user friendly and easy to understand and use
	It gives most appropriate movie recommended list.
 
#  Conclusion: 
In this project we have introduced recommender system for movie recommendation. It allows a user to select his choices from a given set of attributes and then recommend him a movie list of 5 movies.Eventually we implement a web based user interface.
# FutureScope: 
The web of can be further modified music recommendation, Fashion recommendation, books recommendation, news recommendation , articles recommendation, videos recommendation & products recommendation.
